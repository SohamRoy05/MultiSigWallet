# MultiSignature Wallet

A MultiSig wallet is a digital wallet that operates with multisignature addresses. This means that it requires more than one private key to sign and authorize a crypto transaction or, in some cases, that several different keys can be used to generate a signature.
From a security perspective, it is vital that coins and tokens are stored in a way that eliminates the risk associated with a single vulnerable point that can compromise the entire wallet. If only one private key is necessary to sign a transaction, this presents a major risk to your assets in case of theft or loss. To mitigate this problem, it is best to use a wallet that needs more than one private key for the authorization of transactions. 

This MultiSignature wallet allows upto 3 signers to store their coins. It requires the permission of all the signers to authorize a transaction. To become a signer, you need to deposit non-zero amount of coins to the wallet. To leave the wallet, your spent amount should be less than or equal to your deposited coins and then, like transactions, you require permission of everyone in the wallet to leave.
